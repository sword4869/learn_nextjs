# wet
```js
export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..')
  return res.json()
}
```
Note: Next.js polyfills `fetch()` on both the client and server. You don't need to import it.

# database

```js
import someDatabaseSDK from 'someDatabaseSDK'

const databaseClient = someDatabaseSDK.createClient(...)

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from a database
  return databaseClient.query('SELECT posts...')
}
```
This is possible because `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side. It will never run on the client-side. It wonâ€™t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.
